          <p><strong>Imagine this scenario:</strong><p>
          <p>Your car breaks down in the middle of a deserted road in a foreign country where you don’t speak the language and you have little working knowledge of cars in general.  You manage to get your car towed to a mechanic in the nearest town.  The mechanic has no real means of communicating but simply writes down a number that you are expected to pay to have your car up and running.</p>
          <p>This unfortunately translates to the feelings of most patients when it comes to their healthcare. Patients are told they have a problem about something the have very little understanding of and do not speak the language regarding the issue. Regardless of how good the “mechanic” in this story is, someone’s ability to understand and synthesize the information presented is understandably poor.</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>Now, imagine you break down again in the same country but happen to be traveling with a friend who speaks the language and happens to be a car enthusiast and works on cars as a passion.  They patiently walk you through exactly what is wrong with your car, translate what the mechanic is saying to you, and explain what your all your options are to fix your car based on the evidence described by the experts in the field.</p>
          <p>That is what Medsplained is offering to consumers for their healthcare needs or the needs of their loved ones.  We want to translate this foreign language of medicine to the public and offer our knowledge accumulated from years of studying and training so that you are empowered to make the best decision for you and/or your loved one.  We do this through the help of the best and brightest resident physicians in the country trained in the must up to date, evidenced based practices.</p>
