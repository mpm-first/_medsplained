        <p>MedSplained is a service that aims to help you understand more about your health or the health of a loved one through personalized education. We do not try <strong>(and really shouldn’t)</strong> give a diagnosis or conclusion on a specific problem or condition.  This is best done by your treating physician (primary care provider, specialist or surgeon) who has the opportunity to know your full medical history, examine you and prescribe treatment. Our job is to help you understand elements of your care. We are here to listen and answer any questions you might have, explain all the options regarding your care and make sure you feel confident in owning your healthcare going forward. Our goal is not to diagnose or treat you, but to put you in the driver’s seat of your healthcare so that you and your doctor together can make the best decision for your health and your life.</p>

        <p>While we will meet you where-ever you are along your health journey, MedSplained cannot offer medical advice or treatment. This is best done by the doctor or healthcare provider who take care of you, knows you best and has examined you. We are here to be your health partner and offer you all the information available regarding your condition or proposed treatment. We put you in touch with specialized doctors who can explain everything in such a way that you will be able to take ownership over your healthcare needs.  This empowers you to make the best plan with your doctor about next steps.</p>
